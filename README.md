## Projects



### Project: File Operations with Node.js

- **Description**: This project demonstrates how to read and write files using Node.js, and highlights the differences between synchronous and asynchronous approaches to file operations.

- **Features**:
  - **Read Files**: Capable of reading content from files using both synchronous and asynchronous methods.
  - **Write Files**: Supports writing content to files with both synchronous and asynchronous approaches.
  - **Error Handling**: Includes mechanisms for handling errors that occur during file operations.
  - **Performance Comparison**: Provides a comparative analysis of synchronous vs asynchronous file operations in terms of performance and efficiency.
  - **Configuration**: Allows configuration of file paths and operation modes through environment variables or configuration files.
  - **Logging**: Logs operations and errors for debugging and analysis.

- **Technologies Used**: Node.js, File System (fs) module, Environment Variables
